# dua-cli

The [official repository](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli) lacks support for architectures such as `aarch64-apple-darwin`. This repository aims to build the following architectures:

- aarch64-unknown-linux-musl
- aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
- aarch64-apple-darwin
- x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
- x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
- x86_64-apple-darwin
